# Convex-hull
This code is an implementation of the paper 'An Efficient Convex Hull Finding Algorithm for Graphical Models'.
"Example_UG" is a visual display of the PMSA algorithm. PMSA and MSF files are used to store the codes of PMSA and MSF algorithms, respectively. "Structural dimension reduction" is an example of using the PMSA algorithm to achieve structural dimension reduction.
